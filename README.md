## General
- [A short introduction to molecular biology](http://www.thomas-schlitt.net/Bioproject.html) target audience: computer scientist
- https://bioinfo-fr.net/ [French]
- [Awesome single cell](https://github.com/seandavi/awesome-single-cell) 
- 
## Transcriptomics
- https://www.rna-seqblog.com/ Collect the publications and presentations around RNA-seq

### Bulk RNAseq

### scRNAseq

## Proteomics - MS-based data
- [www.proteomics.rocks](http://proteomicsnews.blogspot.com/) Blog on MS proteomics by [Ben Orsburn](https://github.com/orsburn)
- [www.ms-utils.org](https://www.ms-utils.org/) : is a list of free (gratis) software for analysis of mass spectrometry data. It is both a repository and a collection of up-to-date links to different types of freely available software and code snippets for the visualization and analysis of mass spectrometry data with emphasis on automated methods for proteomics and protein analysis.
